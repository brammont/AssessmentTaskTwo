            <summary>
            Returns the velocity of a star in m/sec based on the doppler effect, it uses
            the rest and observed wavelength of light from star. The wave length is measured 
            in nanometres = 1 x 10^-9, speed of light = 3 x 10^8 m/s. If a star has 500.0 nm at rest
            and 500.1 nm observed then velocity is 60,000 m/s
